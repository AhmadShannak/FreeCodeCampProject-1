     								<li><h4 >2013</h4></li>
     								<p >
     									Faker's early gaming experience included custom maps on Warcraft 3, particularly Footman Frenzy and DotA. He started playing League of Legends in December 2011 when the Korean server opened. Faker initially played normal (casual) games but switched to ranked play when the League of Legends matchmaking system could no longer find players of equivalent skill for him to play against. Under the name “GoJeonPa,” he climbed the Korean ladder and became a strong mid-laner, known for his aggressive play and impressive mechanics. Faker achieved the no. 1 ranking in solo queue and began attracting the attention of several Korean e-sports organisations. There were rumours of many offers from prospective teams but Faker decided to join SK Telecom T1 in February 2013 and played on their second team, “SKT T1 2.” For More Of His Story In 2013 Click <a href="http://lol.gamepedia.com/Faker#2013">This</a> .

     								<li><h4>2014</h4></li>
     								<p>
     									Faker and SKT T1 K (as they were now known) began the 2014 season in emphatic fashion, going undefeated through the PANDORA.TV Champions Winter 2013-2014 season, defeating old rivals KT Rolster Bullets and Samsung Ozone along the way. Faker was again named MVP of the tournament and achieved a KDA of 7. This triumph made SKT T1 K the first team to ever win two seasons of Champions Korea, a feat which installed them as perhaps the greatest League of Legends team the game had seen thus far. HOT6iX Champions Spring 2014 proved to be much more difficult for SKT however, as they battled a changing meta-game and the loss of support player PoohManDu to illness. After scraping through the group stages they were eliminated by Samsung Ozone with a score of 3-1. Faker was still receiving acclaim from commentators for his performance but it was clear that his team was not the powerhouse it once was. Despite this slump, SKTs victory in Champions winter had earned them the right to attend All-Star Paris 2014 as the representative from Korea. There they competed against the winners of each of the other major regions and defeated them all, winning the tournament without dropping a game. Their international victory did nothing to improve their domestic woes however, as the team crashed out of HOT6iX Champions Summer 2014, once again in the quarterfinals, and once again at the hands of Samsung White (formerly Ozone). Faker’s performances were showing the strain of having to carry his underperforming teammates. For More Of His Story In 2014 Click <a href="http://lol.gamepedia.com/Faker#2013">This</a> .

     								<li><h4>2015</h4></li>
     								<p>
     									The 2015 season began with a major upheaval in the Korean League of Legends scene as governing body Kespa implemented a new league-based format and a large number of high-profile Korean stars were signed to Chinese teams. Despite rumours of lucrative offers in the order of 1 million USD, Faker chose to remain with SK Telecom T1, making him easily the most celebrated player left in the region. His new team consisted of players from his old sister team, SKT T1 S, as well as long time teammate Bengi. Controversially, Faker was forced to split his playtime on the team with the mid-laner from SKT T1 S, Easyhoon. Some believed that Faker should have started every game whilst others argued that having two mid-laners with contrasting playstyles increased the number of strategies that SKT could implement. In any case, Faker’s new team were one of the top contenders throughout 2015 LCK Spring and even went undefeated throughout the second round robin of the season, earning them second place overall and automatic placement into the semi-finals of the playoffs. Faker achieved 2nd in the MVP standings with eight best-on-the-rift performances despite playing only two thirds of SK Telecom’s games. SKT’s semi-final opponent CJ Entus jumped out to a 2-0 lead when the two teams met in the LCK Playoffs before Faker and his teammates managed to turn the series around and force a fifth and final game. In accordance with Korean tradition, this game was played in blind pick, leaving CJ unable to ban Faker’s signature champion, Leblanc. Faker proceeded to carry the game on this pick, preserving his undefeated record on the champion and elevating the renown of his Leblanc to almost mythic proportions. Faker was not required to play in the final as Easyhoon and the other members of SKT scored an easy 3-0 victory against the GE tigers. This was a record third title for SK Telecom and installed Faker and Bengi as the only players to have ever won three domestic seasons in Korea.

     								<li><h4>2016</h4></li>
     								<p>
     									Faker and team had a good start in 2016 as they won IEM X World Championship after beating Fnatic (3-0). They then finished 3rd in the regular split of 2016 LCK Spring but won the entire tournament after dominating ROX Tigers in a 3-1 victory. SKT proceed to winning the 2016 Mid-Season Invitational against Counter Logic Gaming (3-0). The team placed 2nd in 2016 LCK Summer then lost to KT Rolster (2-3) in the playoffs. However, KT Rolster failed to beat ROX Tigers in the finals, thus giving SKT the chance to be one of the representatives of LCK for the 2016 World Championship which they have won (for the 3rd time) after beating ROX Tigers (3-2) in the semifinals and ending the series 3-2 against Samsung Galaxy in the finals. Moving forward, the team had to face ROX Tigers again in the semifinals of the 2016 LoL KeSPA Cup where the team's effort fell short and losing the best of 3 series (0-2).
										For the 2017 Season, Faker will continue to play for SKT as the starting Mid Laner but the team added Sky to the roster as his substitute.
